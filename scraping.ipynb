      "💬 If you are an American, especially an American student please do NOT waste your time or money investing into this bank. This bank is the biggest scam I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Specifically this branch, it is the worst. I signed up with his bank through my school, and it seemed like from day one I had nothing but the worst experience. First of all, they kept giving me the wrong code to activate my account, so I was never able to access my student loans, which made me late for rent payments in both America and in France. They also kept giving me excuses and the runaround so it got to the point where I said that I didn’t even wanna keep my student loans in this bank anymore and I just wanted to wire transfer everything to my American bank account. I tried to do the wire transfer, but the most incompetent woman I’ve ever met in my entire life, somehow was unable to write down the proper information for a wire transfer, so then she has the audacity to email me, ironically two minutes before the bank closes, and say that she got the information wrong and proceeded to ask me to send her a screenshot of my AMERICAN bank account information so she can “do the wire transfer.” Obviously, I was extremely upset because any person with a brain knows that you never do something like that, and I even called my bank in America to verify if what I thought about this being illegal and suspicious activity, they confirmed that it is suspicious and they even asked me if I was talking to a real bank teller because they said that NO bank teller that actually knows what they are doing would ever ask me to do such a thing. It got to the point where I had to report them to the embassy, as well as the school that I was attending, because they refused to hold the bank accountable for it’s actions. I wanted to close my account with the bank, but my school told me that I needed to have a French bank account open to keep my Visa, and I believed that lie, so I kept the bank account open for a few more months, but of course they gave me nothing but pure hell. In the beginning, they told me that there would be no fees for me because I’m a student and OF COURSE they lied and there WERE service fees, I also realized that they charge me higher service fees than they did some of the other students. My service fees were €10 other people had €8 and other people had €0… how are we getting different service fees when we all go to the same school and opened the exact same type of bank account at the exact same time??? They also would tell me whatever they felt like telling me, one day she said that I can only withdraw €20 minimum from the ATM but then I come back a few days later and she told me that I actually can withdraw €10 from the ATM. They also made it impossible for me to get my account to zero when I wanted to close it, it’s almost as if I had to sneak and get my account to zero because if they saw me wanting to withdraw all my money, they asked me “ Are you trying to close your bank account?” “ do you need to get to a zero balance?” Why do you care BNP??? What do you want me to do, go into debt with you or something? Most PROFESSIONAL banks don’t care if somebody wants to get their account to zero or close with them, if they actually have money then they’re not going to hold people’s money hostage. I can go on and on and on about the bs that this bank put me through. I almost want to sue them (alongside my school that enabled this bank’s unprofessionalism) for fraud and emotional distress. I did report them to the (redacted) and (redacted). Perhaps I’m just one report but I’m 1000% going to let every American student know that if they’ve had the same problem with his bank please do not be afraid to report them to the (redacted) as well. The USA needs to know that these people are playing with their FEDERAL money.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: they made me remove the name of the lady who completely screwed me over and almost drove me up the wall mentally. No matter, I can delete her name, but it still doesn’t erase the fact that this bank is horrible, and that NOBODY should never engage with any of its employees or anybody associated with this waste of wood. Also, I know that they are reading this review, it doesn’t matter if I erase her name from this review, I already sent her THIS BANK AND HER FULL NAME to the (redacted), when I reported the bank to them…so the people reading this review might not know her name, but TRUST ME, the (redacted) knows her name and that’s the ONLY people/federation who needs to know :-)\n",
      "EDIT 2: once again this bank is showing how completely incompetent and narcissistic they are. They are trying to say that I acted out with one of their employees. YES that tends to happen when people are STEALING from you & lying. Also ONE argument out of 100 other respectful encounters, doesn’t make me a bad customer, it only proves that YOU’RE a bad business. LYING SCAMMERS.\n",

      "Two weeks after opening the account on a Thursday while abroad my card and online banking access is suddenly locked after trying to do a small payment, for 2 days I try to contact someone at the bank with multiple numbers I am given over the calls to their various numbers.

On Tuesday after calling multiple times again I manage to get someone to open access to my online banking, he explained my card was revoked the week before (that I cancelled it?) he is not sure, but it definitely cannot be reactivated. They can only send a new one within the French territory. At this point I'm already a bit shocked by the whole response, what if I only had this card, this account and since 5 days no one in this bank has cared for a second that their customer has been left without access to his balance.\n",
      "With the online banking access reestablished my first thought is to transfer most of my money out, this is when I realise that although the online banking access is back the transfers page is locked, it tells me to call the bank... great.\n",
      "Over the next week, with no luck reaching anyone by phone who can explain anything and having left multiple messages in the bank contact form, I decide to start officially closing the account sending dated and signed letters in case further moderation is needed. To make the rest of the story shorter the following events ensued. My direct debits are all rejected although I sent a letter to ensure they would go through (someone says I rejected the payments? they seems confused, someone will check...) My account closing is programmed for December, in 3 months when legally it should take 30 days max. Transfers stay locked for the next week and until the closing of the account. I send official documents with the legal obligations that the bank has failed in, with this 24 hours later they finally comply and transfer my balance -3.50 Euro that they keep as a transfer fee for the SEPA payment to my other national account, a real bunch of thieves considering the last 3 weeks service they provided.

My account was terminated by the bank citing a clause allowing either party to terminate the agreement within 3 months without providing a reason. Despite having insurance with them, which was sold to me as a full package with excellent coverage, it did not cover the cost of damaged items during an attack on me while in public transport. I personally requested access to the security cameras footage from the transport provider, which clearly showed the attacker, but the bank's affiliated company, AG Insurance, refused to provide any compensation as they couldn't identify anyone to blame for the damage.

      "💬 I hardly ever write negative reviews unless it is truly bad. This bank is a joke unfortunately. Worst non-responsive, unprofessional, incompetent customer service. Their Service international section is a joke. My mother who is unable to travel due to covid, has been requesting a code to access her account virtually. The bank has been clear with what information she needs to provide to complete transactions. She has been on the phone for hours trying to resolve the issue, customer service attempts to call but \"glitchy disconnects\" continue to happen. Very outdated technology and procedures. My mother asked to speak to a supervisor. They requested to write a letter and send through post mail to talk to supervisors.... Basically, they are keeping my mother's money hostage. She cannot access her account because they don't want to send her a code to access virtually, she is not receiving bank statements, is unable to check her balance, unable to transfer money, unable to communicate with a competent customer service agent. DON'T OPEN AN ACCOUNT THERE. IF YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT, LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE.\n",

      "After I opened the account, I didn't receive a card and a pin, and it turned out that the manager did not write my address correctly, so such a precious thing like my bank card together with the pin were sent to the wrong place! But even that is not the end! My manager gave me the wrong e-mail and wrong phone number, so I can't contact her, I went to the bank to request a new card. They blocked the old one, created the new one, and one week later I received everything, the code and the card, but however, the pin they sent me was incorrect, when I went to the bank again, the lady at the reception was extremely rude, telling me it's not her fault because it's not her who is sending the post. She told me to go away and wait. However, she did not tell me if the correct pin was sent, she did not even make an effort to check anything on the computer. She just started speaking faster French to make me freak out and leave. I will definitely leave the reviews everywhere possible and return ASAP with someone french-speaking because I have a lot of money stuck in this terrible bank without an opportunity to use it.\n",

My suggestion is that always go with an International bank like HSBC. In 2021 if a bank is not digital it will not survive. do not put your money in such a bank.\n",

      "In September 2019 I was the victim of a sophisticated fraud at a bike rental terminal in London. The French crook, who asked for my help, persuaded me--assisted my a fake \"help-desk\" accomplice --to use my Lloyds, then HSBC and then BNP Paribas Fortis cards, all swallowed by the machine. Subsequently the French scammer recovered the cards and took money from all three accounts including the 3000 Euros monthly limits from my BNP Paribas Fortis account ( and the lower daily limit from my Lloyds and HSBC accounts). BNP Paribas Fortis systems were unable to recognise as fraudulent the nine withdrawals/debits within a very short period but the more effective HSBC fraud alert system warned me. I then phoned Brussels to block the Fortis card. Lloyds and HSBC reimbursed me in full without delay. The Belgian bank decided that, in its own judgment, I had committed \"gross negligence\" in not recognising the loss of my card as a potential theft,saw no obligation to compensate wholly or partially and rejected my claim out of hand. Totally self-serving, heartless and incompetent. Don't think of opening an account with BNP Paribas Fortis !\n",

      "💬 This bank and especially this branch has been the worst bank I've ever had. I'll explain you some examples: 1. They changes my personal bank consultant many many times and each time they didn't notify me. So each time I had to discover that my 'conseiller' is a new person. 2. Almost all of these 'conseillers' were necer available to respond me over phone or answer my emails on time. It looks like they have few good, motivated and dedicated conseillers that they assign them to their big rich clients and the rest, who are actually normal clients with medium to high revenue range, they assign them to junior or not-dedicated conseillers. 3. Once and only once my account passed the minus limit for a week or 2, for each rejected payments they charged me a big fee. I had all my insurances with them and I always had enough money in my account. You can judge the service when things go wrong and yes they didn't pass. 4. I had an issue with my online account and I sent hundreds of emails, many phone calls, asking for the resolution, and guess what I still have the issue after almost 2 years. 5. I have issues to transfer money online and I have asked for resolution but no answer at all. So each time I have to send money to someone I have to call and ask for the service or go to the bank, and guess what I realized that they were charging me around 4 euros each time they did this for me. 6. My visa card was expiring so I requested a new card, it arrived around 1 month after the expiry of last card, even though I had told them in advance, so imagine 1 month with no card. 7. I received a letter saying that my card is arrived to the bank and is ready for pick up, so I went the day after to the bank and they said it's not here, with no sorrow or anything!!!\n",
